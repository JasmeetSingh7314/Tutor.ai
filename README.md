# Tutor AI 🚀  
**Revolutionizing Language Learning with AI**

Tutor AI is a **smart, adaptive platform** that generates personalized lessons, quizzes, and gamified experiences tailored to each user. Built with cutting-edge technologies like **ReactJS**, **NodeJS**, **Python**, and **Pydantic**, it combines the accessibility of YouTube with the precision of AI-driven education.  

Overcoming API limitations, we integrated **OpenRouter** and **Deepseek** to deliver a seamless learning experience. Now, we’re taking it to the next level by exploring **on-chain integration with Sonic** for decentralized, gamified rewards.
